# Literals and the `const` keyword

We want to be able to support a few things:

* writing numbers that will act as field elements directly in the code
* writing numbers that will act as relatively small numbers (for indexing into arrays for example) in the code
* writing functions that will accept constant arguments. For example to index into an array.

The first two points allow us to write things like that:

```rust
let x = 3;
assert_eq(y[5], 4);
```

The third point allows us to write things like that:

```rust
fn House.get(self, room: Field) -> Field {
    return House.rooms[room];
}
```

Since `House` takes a `Field` here, it can in theory be used with anything during type checking.

This is bad. There are two solutions:

1. During type checking, when we realize that `room` is used to index into an array, we enforce that it must be a constant value during compilation.
2. We create a distinct type for constants and literals.

Approach 1. is not elegant, because it means that it is not clear from the signature of the function alone that the `room` argument must be a constant.
The user of the function will only get warned when trying to compile the program.

Approach 2. is interesting, because we already have such a type internally to track literals: a `BigInt`.
The name is a bit misleading in the case of array accesses, because we additionally enforce that it is NOT a big integer, but rather a 32-bit integer (`u32` in Rust).

## Implementing a literal type

Approach 2 can be implemented in two ways:

a. Use a brand new type, like `BigInt` for literals.
b. Use a `const` attribute to indicate that it is a constant.

Approach a. is a bit clumsy in my opinion because the developer needs to remember about a new type name, and understand the distinction with that and `Field`.

On the other hand, approach b. uses the `const` keyword which is already well-known in many compiled programming languages.

What about this:

```rust
fn House.get(self, const room: Field) -> Field {
// versus
fn House.get(self, room: const Field) -> Field {
```

To contrast, the two other existing attributes (`pub` and `mut`) are placed in front of the variable names, not the type names.

One could argue that the type is the same, but the variable being passed is a constant, and so it makes more sense to implement the first version.
This is what we do in noname.

At the time of this writing, the `const` keyword only seems to make sense in a function argument, and so is implemented in the same way as the `pub` attribute:

```rust
pub enum AttributeKind {
    Pub,
    Const,
}

pub struct Attribute {
    pub kind: AttributeKind,
    pub span: Span,
}

pub struct FnArg {
    pub name: Ident,
    pub typ: Ty,
    pub attribute: Option<Attribute>,
    pub span: Span,
}
```

When a function is parsed by the type checker, a `const Field` is transformed into a `BigInt`.
And as such, the type checker will be happy with that variable being used to index into an array, or being used by other functions expecting a constant.

What about other types being `const`? 
I don't think it makes sense for now, as I can only think of array access requiring this.
So we don't implement it.

```admonish
If we do want to support that one day, we will have to track more than `TyKind` in the typechecker...
This can be achieved by adding a `const` field in the `TypeInfo` structure that tracks type-related data on noname variables present in the scope.
```
